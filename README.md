# StudyStream

## About The Project

StudyStream is a tool that enables students to extract the information that is most relevant to them from their recorded Zoom lectures. This tool scans the chat and lecture transcripts, and creates relevant flashcards that the student can later study. With the rise of online learning, students that miss class or are reviewing old Zoom lectures need a way to easily and efficiently access the critical information from class while skimming over the less important moments. StudyStream is at the cutting edge of this trend. By parsing Zoom lectures into a flashcard format that makes it easy to study and learn the content of the lecture, StudyStream gives students the tools to succeed in an online learning environment.
